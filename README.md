## Description

This is a front-end web application with full CRUD functionality. A user can view a list of all parks, add a new park, edit and delete an existing park. This application uses [ParkAPI](https://github.com/TSiu88/ParkAPI), a previously built C#/.NET API project, as the back-end that was deployed to [Azure](http://park-info-api.azurewebsites.net/index.html).  The project was deployed multiple times on Netlify when completed (links in Setup section).

This project also contains Redux Thunk middleware, a custom written logger middleware, uses the Fetch library, and uses D3.js data visualization.

For the back-end API, a user can add information and locations of parks found in the US. The parks can be stored with a name, type (national or state), description, location/city, and state. The database can be searched for these properties with the correct route structure. States can also be stored in another table in the database and also holds the number of parks that are within that state. The number of parks updates when parks are added, deleted, or modified.

## Setup/Installation Requirements

Follow the instructions below to run this project locally.

Otherwise, this project is also deployed on Netlify and ready-to-use from [Krista's repo](https://parks-api.netlify.app/), [Tiffany's repo](https://park-info-api.netlify.app/), [Adela's repo](https://final-react-week.netlify.app/), and [Andriy's repo](https://friendly-engelbart-8e49be.netlify.app/). We recommend using a **CORS blocker** app or [a Chrome extension like this](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en) to access the API, as the backend is not set to receive Cross-Origin requests, even when using our deployed sites.

### Requirements to Run

* _Web Browser_
* _Webpack_
* _Node.js_
* _NPM_
* _React_
* _Redux_

### Instructions

*This page may be viewed by:*

1. Download and install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
2. Install [CORS Unblock](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cors-unblock/lfhmikememgdcahcdlaciloancbhjino?hl=en), a Chrome (or other browser) extension to prevent CORS errors.
3. Clone the [repository](https://github.com/ayohana/parks-redux.git) from my [GitHub page](https://github.com/TSiu88)
4. Use a command line/Bash to move to the project directory with `cd project-directory`
5. Run `npm install` to get all dependencies. 
6. Run `npm start` to start up the program 
7. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser and turn on **CORS Unblock** to see the site.

## Notable Features
The database for this project is deployed in Azure while the front end was built in React locally and is able to make calls to the deployed API to modify the database.  It has a D3.js data visualization map that is color coded to number of parks in the database that is located in that state with tooltips that pop up with mouseover.  The resulting application was also deployed using Netlify on multiple accounts.
